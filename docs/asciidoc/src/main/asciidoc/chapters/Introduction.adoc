== Introduction to Byteman

Byteman is a bytecode manipulation tool which makes it simple to change the operation of
Java applications either at load time or while the application is running. It works without the
need to rewrite or recompile the original program. In fact, Byteman can even be used to
modify Java code which forms part of the Java virtual machine, classes such as String,
Thread etc. Byteman employs a clear, simple and easy-to-use Event Condition Action
(ECA) rule language, based on Java. ECA rules are used to specify where, when and how
the original Java code should be transformed to modify its operation. +

Byteman was invented primarily to support automation of tests for multi-threaded and
multi-JVM Java applications using a technique called fault injection. It includes features
which have been designed to resolve problems which arise with this type of testing.
Byteman provides explicit support for test automation in four main areas: +

* tracing execution of specific code paths and displaying application or JVM state
* subverting normal execution by changing state, making unscheduled method calls
or forcing an unexpected return or throw
* orchestrating the timing of activities performed by independent application threads
* monitoring and gathering statistics summarising application and JVM operation

Byteman is actually of much more general use than as a tool for testing. The core engine
which underlies Byteman is a general purpose code injection program capable of injecting
inline Java code into almost any location reachable during execution of a Java method. Byteman
rule conditions and actions can employ all the normal Java built-in operations in order to
test and modify program state. They can also invoke methods of application or JVM
instances which are in scope at the injection point. +

The Byteman rule language provides a standard set of built-in operations which support
specific tasks from the categories outlined above. For example, a rule condition may
enforce a wait on a thread rendezvous or an action may update a statistical counter. The
available set of built-in calls is configured using a POJO plugin. This can easily be
replaced with an alternative implementation either for a set of rules or on a piecemeal
basis for individual rules. This makes it trivial to modify and/or extend the rule language to
support ad-hoc program modifications which are specific to the application domain. +

=== Running an Application with the Byteman Agent

In order to use Byteman to test a Java application the JVM must be configured to load and
run the Byteman rule engine. At the most basic level this can be achieved using the
`-javaagent` command line argument. The trailing text appended to this argument points
the JVM at a jar containing the Byteman rule engine. It may also identify the location of
one or more Byteman rule scripts, specifying
side-effects to be injected into the application under test. The engine reads these scripts
when the application is launched and applies the rules contained in the scripts to any matching classes and methods. Shell command scripts are provided to simplify the task of loading the
agent and installing rules into your program. +

In order to simplify test automation Byteman has been integrated with the two popular
testing frameworks JUnit and TestNG, allowing Byteman tests to be driven from either ant
or Maven. Using the integration modules fault injection testing involves no more than
annotating your program with suitable rules and ensuring that the Byteman jars are located
in the classpath.

If your Java application is a long-running program then you may want to load the rule
scripts and, possibly even, the rule engine after the program has started running. For
example, you may decide to install Byteman into your application server when it appears
to be suffering from performance problems and only then upload rules which trace
execution of the code you suspect is misbehaving. Once the rule engine is loaded it
cannot be unloaded. However, rules can be added and removed ad lib, allowed you to
focus in on the problem in hand using more and more specific trace or monitoring rules.
Note that when rules are removed the methods they affect are guaranteed to return to their
original behaviour.

Full details of how to install the Byteman agent and how to upload rules either at boot time
or at runtime are provided in subsection Using Byteman. Full examples of how to use
Byteman from the command line, plus examples of how to configure annotation based
fault injection testing from ant or Maven project, are available in the online tutorials which
are linked from the documentation page of the Byteman site http://www.jboss.org/byteman.

=== Event Condition Action Rules

The Byteman rule engine operates by introducing side-effects at specified points during
execution. A Byteman script comprises a sequence of Event Condition Action (ECA) rules
which specify precisely how the application behaviour should be transformed at runtime.
The three components of these rules, event, condition and action, are used, respectively,
to define:

* _where_ during application execution a side-effect should occur
* _whether_ the side-effect should happen or not
* _what_ the side effect should be

For example, in the following example rule the event is defined by the `CLASS`, `METHOD` and
`AT INVOKE` clauses. It specifies a trigger point in method `get()` of class
`BoundedBuffer`. The example assumes that the definition of method `get()` includes a
call to `Object.wait()`. This would be appropriate if, say, the buffer were empty. The
location specifier `AT INVOKE` places the trigger point just before the call to this method.

----
  RULE throw on Nth empty get
  CLASS org.my.BoundedBuffer
  METHOD get()
  AT INVOKE Object.wait()
  BIND buffer = $this
  IF countDown(buffer)
  DO throw new org.my.ClosedException(buffer)
  ENDRULE
----

The event also includes a `BIND` clause which establishes a binding for local variable
buffer assigning it with the value `$this` (a rather artificial thing to do but this is an
example). `$this` is an automatic binding which refers to the target of the the `get()` call
which triggered the rule. buffer can be referred to later in the rule; in this case it is
passed as an argument to the exception constructor in the `DO` clause.

The condition is defined by the `IF` clause. It invokes the standard Byteman built-in
`countDown(Object)` which decrements a `CountDown` associated with the buffer ─ the
example assumes some other rule has called `createCountDown(buffer, N)` to create
this CountDown and initialise it with value N. The `countDown` built-in returns true 
when the value of the CountDown decrements to zero.

The action is defined by the `DO` clause. It causes an instance of `ClosedException` to be
created and thrown from the `get()` call which triggered the rule.

So, in this example the condition will evaluate to `false` the first N-1 times that a getter
attempts to wait. At the Nth triggering the condition will evaluate to `true` and the rule will
fire, running the built-in action throw. This will cause the triggering thread to throw a
`ClosedException` to the caller of method `get()`.

=== Rule Bindings and Parameterization

The corresponding rule to set up the countDown might be defined as follows

----
  RULE set up buffer countDown
  CLASS org.my.BoundedBuffer
  METHOD <init>(int)
  AT EXIT
  BIND buffer = $0;
  size = $1
  IF $1 < 100
  DO createCountDown(buffer, size - 1)
  ENDRULE
----

This rule is attached to the constructor for class `BoundedBuffer` which takes a single
int parameter. The `AT EXIT` location means it is triggered just before the constructor
returns. The `BIND` clause employs the indexed notation to refer to the method target, `$0`,
and the first argument `$1`. The latter is assumed for the sake of the example to be the
buffer size. If the buffer size is less than 100 then the rule creates a `countDown` with
count `size` `–1` using the buffer as a key to identify it.

Notice how the parameterization of the `createCountDown` and `countDown` calls with
the bound variable buffer restricts the scope of these rules to specific cases. If there are
two buffers, `buffer1` and `buffer2`, but only `buffer1` has size less than 100 then the
condition for the set up rule will return false when `buffer2` is created. This means the
action will not run and a countDown will not be associated with `buffer2.` When a
subsequent call is made to `buffer2.get()` the throw rule will be triggered but the
condition will always return false and the rule will not fire.

If instead both buffers have size less than 100 then two countDowns will be created. The
throw rule will be triggered when either `buffer1.get()` and `buffer2.get()` is called
and in both cases will eventually fire and throw an exception. However, each countDown
will still decrement independently.

=== Built-in Conditions and Actions

Byteman provides a suite of built-in conditions and actions used to coordinate the activities
of independent threads e.g. delays, waits and signals, countdowns, flag operations and so
on. These are particularly useful for testing multi-threaded programs subject to arbitrary
scheduling orders. Judicious insertion of byteman actions can guarantee that thread
interleavings in a given test run will occur in a desired order, enabling test code to reliably
exercise parallel execution paths which do not normally occur with synthetic workloads.

Tracing operations are also provided so that test scripts can track progress of a test run
and identify successful or unsuccessful test completion. Trace output can also be used to
debug rule execution. Trace output to be quite finely tuned simply by providing a condition
which tests the state of local or parameter variable bindings. Trace actions can insert 
these bound values into message strings, allowing detailed scrutiny of test execution paths.

A few special built-in actions can be used to subvert the behaviour of application code by
modifying execution paths. This is particularly important in a test environment where it is
often necessary to force application methods to generate dummy results or simulate an
error.

A _return_ action forces an early return from the code location targeted by the rule. If the
method is non-void then the return action supplies a value to use as the method result.

A _throw_ action enables exceptions to be thrown from the trigger method frame. A rule is
always allowed to throw a runtime exception (i.e. instances of `RuntimeException` or its
subclasses). If none of the caller methods up the stack from the trigger method include a a
catch for `RuntimeException` or `Throwable` then effectively this aborts the current
thread. Other exceptions may also be thrown so long as the trigger method declares the
exception in its throws list. This restriction is necessary to ensure that the injected code
does not break the method contract between the trigger method and its callers.

Finally, a call to the `killJVM()` builtin allows a machine crash to be simulated by configuring
an immediate exit from the JVM.

It is worth noting that rules are not just restricted to using built-in operations. Application-
specific side-effects can also be introduced by writing object fields or calling Java methods
in rule events, conditions or actions. The obvious target for such field write or method call
operations is objects supplied from the triggering method via local or parameter variable
bindings. However, it is also possible to update static data and invoke static methods of
any class accessible from the classloader of the triggering method. So, it is quite feasible
to use Byteman rules to apply arbitrary modifications to the original program. Byteman
rules have special access privileges which means that it is possible to read and write
protected or private fields and call protected or private data.

=== Extending or Replacing the Byteman Language Built-ins

Another option to bear in mind is that the set of built-in operations available to Byteman
rules is not fixed. The rule engine works by mapping built-in operations which occur in a
given rule to public instance methods of a helper class associated with the rule. By default,
this helper class is `org.jboss.byteman.rule.helper.Helper`. which provides the
standard set of built-ins designed to simplify management of threads in a multi-threaded
application. For example, the builtin operations `createCountDown()` and `countDown()` 
used in the example rules provided above are just public methods of class Helper. The
set of built-ins available for use in a given rule can by changed merely by specifying an
alternative helper class for that rule.

Any non-abstract class may be specified as the helper. Its public instance methods
automatically become available as built-in operations in the rule event, condition and
action. For example, by specifying a helper class which extended the default class, Helper,
a rule would be able to use any of the existing built-ins and/or also make rule-specific (or
application-specific) built-in calls. So, although the default Byteman rule language is
oriented towards orchestrating the behaviour of independent threads in multi-threaded
tests, Byteman can easily be reconfigured to support a much wider range of application
requirements.

=== Agent Transformation

The bytecode modifications performed by Byteman are implemented using a _Java agent_ program. 
JVM class loaders provide agents with an opportunity to modify loaded bytecode
just prior to compilation (see package `java.lang.Instrumentation` for details of how
Java agents work). The Byteman agent reads the rule script at JVM bootstrap. It then
monitors method code as it is loaded looking for _trigger points_, locations in the method
bytecode which match the locations specified in rule events.

The agent inserts _trigger calls_ into code at each point which matches a rule event. Trigger
calls are calls to the rule execution engine which identify:

* the _trigger method_, i.e. the method which contains the trigger point
* the rule which has been matched
* the arguments to the trigger method

If several rules match the same trigger point then there will be a sequence of trigger calls,
one for each matching rule. In this case rules are mostly triggered in the order they appear
in their script(s).The only exception is rules which specify an `AFTER` location, such as
`AFTER READ myField` or `AFTER INVOKE` someMethod, which are executed in reverse
order of appearance.

When a trigger call occurs the rule execution engine locates the relevant rule and then
executes it. The rule execution engine establishes bindings for variables mentioned in the
rule event and then tests the rule condition. If the condition evaluates to true it fires the
rule. executing each of the rule actions in sequence.

Trigger calls pass the method recipient (this) and method arguments to the rule engine.
These values may be referred to in the condition and action with a standard naming
convention, $0, $1 etc. The event specification can introduce bindings for additional
variables. Bindings for these variables may be initialized using literal data or by invoking
methods or operations on the method parameters and/or static data. Variables bound in
the event can simply be referred to by name in the condition or action. Bindings allow
arbitrary data from the triggering context to be tested in the condition in order to decide
whether to fire the rule and to be employed as a target or parameter for rule actions. Note
that where the trigger code is compiled with the relevant debug options enabled the agent
is able to pass local variables which are in scope at the trigger point as arguments to the
trigger call, making them available as default bindings. Rules may refer to in-scope
variables (including the method recipient and arguments) by prefixing their symbolic
names with the $ character e.g. $this, $arg1, $i etc.

The agent also compiles exception handler code around the trigger calls in order to deal
with exceptions which might arise during rule processing. This is not intended to handle
errors detected during operation of the rule execution engine (they should all be caught
and dealt with internally). Exceptions are thrown out of the execution engine to alter the
flow of control through the triggering method. Normally, after returning from a trigger call
the triggering thread continues to execute the original method code. However, a rule can
use the return and throw built-in actions to specify that an early return or exception
throw should be performed from the trigger method. The rule language implementation
achieves this by throwing its own private, internal exceptions below the trigger call. The
handler code compiled into the trigger method catches these internal exceptions and then
either returns to the caller or recursively throws a runtime or application-specific exception.
This avoids normal execution of the remaining code in the body of the triggering method. If
there are other trigger calls pending at the trigger point then these are also bypassed when
a return or throw action is executed.

=== Agent Retransformation

The agent also allows rules to be uploaded while the application is still running. This can
be used to redefine previously loaded rules as well as to introduce new rules on the fly. In
cases where no currently loaded class matches the uploaded rule the agent merely adds
the new rule to the current rule set. This may possibly replace an earlier version of the
rule (rules are equated if they have the same name). When a matching class is loaded the
latest version of the rule will be used to transform it.

In cases where there are already loaded classes which match the rule the agent will
retransform them, modifying the relevant target methods to include any necessary trigger
calls. If an uploaded rule replaces an existing rule in this situation then when the previous
rule is deleted all trigger calls associated with it are removed from the affected target
methods. Note that retransforming a class does not associate a new class object with
existing instances of the class. It merely installs a different implementation for their
methods.

An important point where retransformation may occur automatically without an explicit
upload is during bootstrap of the agent. The JVM needs to load various of its own
bootstrap classes before it can start the agent and allow it to register a transformer. Once
the agent has processed the initial rule set and registered a transformer it scans all
currently loaded classes and identifies those which match rules in the rule set. It
automatically retransforms these classes, causing subsequent calls to bootstrap code to
trigger rule processing.

=== ECA Rule Engine

The Byteman rule execution engine consists of a rule parser, type checker and
interpreter/compiler. The rule parser is invoked by the agent during bootstrap. This
provides enough information to enable the agent to identify potential trigger points.

Rules are not type checked and compiled during trigger injection. These steps are delayed
until the class and method bytecode they refer to has been loaded. Type checking requires
identifying properties of the trigger class and, potentially, of classes it mentions using
reflection. To do this the type checker needs to identify properties of loaded classes such
as the types and accessibility of fields, method signatures etc. So, in order to ensure that
the trigger class and all its dependent classes have been loaded before the type checker
tries to access them, rules are type checked and compiled the first time they are triggered.
This also avoids the cost of checking and compiling rules included in the rule set which do
not actually get called.

A single rule may be associated with more than one trigger point. Firstly, depending upon
how precisely the rule specifies its event, it may apply to more than one class or more
than one method within a class. But secondly, even if a rule specifies a class and method
unambiguously the same class file may be loaded by different class loaders. So, the rule
has to be type checked and compiled for each applicable trigger point.

If a type check or compile operation fails the rule engine prints an error and disables
execution of the trigger call. Note that in cases where the event specification is ambiguous
a rule may type check successfully against one trigger point but not against another. Rule
execution is only disabled for cases where the type check fails.

=== Interpreted or Compiled Execution

In the basic operating mode, trigger calls execute a rule by interpreting the rule parse tree.
It is also possible to translate a rule's bindings, condition and
actions to bytecode which can then be passed by the JIT compiler.
Although the default behaviour is to use the interpreter, this default
can be reset by setting a system property when the agent is installed.
Whatever the global setting it is also possible to select compilation
or interpretation for a given rule by specifying COMPILE or NOCOMPILE
in the rule definition. Although compilation takes slightly more time to execute the first time a rule is run it provides a noticeable performance
pay off where the trigger method gets called many times.

Whichever of mode is chosen,
execution is performed with the help of an auxiliary class generated at runtime by the
Byteman agent called a helper adapter. This class is actually a subclass of the helper
class associated with the rule. It inherits from the helper class so that it knows how to
execute built-in operations defined by the helper class. A subclass is used to add extra
functionality required by the rule system, most notably method execute which gets called
at the trigger point and a local bindings field which stores a hashmap mapping method
parameters and event variables to their bound values.

When a rule is triggered the rule engine creates an instance of the rule's helper adapter
class to provide a context for the trigger call. It uses setter methods generated by the
Byteman agent to initialise the rule and bindings fields and then it calls the adapter
instance's execute method. Since each rule triggering is handled by its own adapter
instance this ensures that concurrent triggers of the same rule from different threads do
not interfere with each other.

The interpreted version of `execute0` locates the triggered rule and, from there, the parse
tree for the event, condition and action. It traverses the parse trees of these three rule
components evaluating each expression recursively. Bindings are looked up or assigned
during rule execution when they are referred to from within the rule event, condition or
action. When the execute method encounters a call to a built-in it can execute this call
using reflection to invoke one of the methods inherited from its helper superclass.
When compilation of rules is enabled the Byteman agent generates an execute method
which contains inline bytecode derived from the rule event condition and action. This
directly encodes all the operations and method invocations defined in the rule. This code
accesses bindings and executes built-ins in the same way as the interpreted code except
that calls to built-in are compiled as direct method invocations on this rather than relying
on reflective invocation.
